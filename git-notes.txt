- - - Notes - - -

Paths
	Paths that start with a / are absolute

Root
	topmost container of a filesystem
	generally restricted to admin users
	never delete anything located directly in the root

var
	for things that change regularly (like logs)
etc
	for files that don’t change regularly
tmp
	for temporary files, gets deleted regularly

Flags
	modify how commands work
	can be combined together ( -lt , -tl , -l -t , -t -l)

Naming
	separate words with - , _ , or with “camel spacing” (myFolder)
	don’t use spaces, because they can be a bitch in UNIX
	Linux is case sensitive, OSX is case insensitive (commands are, however)

Pipe ( | )
	chains commands together
	outputs the first command and uses it as input to the second

Hidden files
	files that begin with a dot (.) are default hidden

‘Dirtying the directory’
	anything that makes the working directory and repo different

Process
	an instance of a program 

Job
	a process that you own

Signal
	a message sent to a process by the operating system


** Git only changes files it’s tracking. Files changed in the working directory that aren’t in the repo won’t be affected by git
